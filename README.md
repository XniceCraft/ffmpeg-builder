# OpenStreamCaster's FFmpeg Builder

Build FFmpeg from scratch with Python!

We already have a bunch of scripts like this. This work is inspired by [ffmpeg-build-script](https://github.com/markus-perl/ffmpeg-build-script/blob/master/build-ffmpeg): Markus did a great job on gathering requirements for multiple components. But I can't use it because of Bash. Bash is a real shit: fragile syntax, no debug, no IDE, no error reporting, nothing. Therefore, it's time to build something similar with a real programming language.

## Usage

* Build:`python3 ./ffmpeg-builder.py --build` and follow on-screen instructions
* Clean:`python3 ./ffmpeg-builder.py --clean`
* Help:`python3 ./ffmpeg-builder.py --help`

## Operating systems

- GNU/Linux
- MacOS
- Windows (MSYS2)

## Windows

Windows is a very unfriendly place. Unfortunately, it's the only place with games.
Don't trust Windows build, and it needs in-depth testing.
Nonetheless, here are the steps to build:

1) [Install MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). It's like ArchLinux, but with Windows Kernel. Follow all steps, update everything as the page says.
2) Cast this magic spell to set up environment: `pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-llvm mingw-w64-x86_64-clang`
3) Install Python `pacman -S python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-pip` and run `pip3 install plumbum`
4) Run `python3 ./ffmpeg-builder.py --build` as usual and pray your gods.

## Platforms

- Python 3 (tested on Python 3.8.2, a default version on Ubuntu 20.04)
- TODO: Docker image
- TODO: Ansible Plugin
