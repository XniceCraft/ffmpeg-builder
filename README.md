# OpenStreamCaster's FFmpeg Builder

Build FFmpeg from scratch with Python!

We already have a bunch of scripts like this. This work is inspired by [ffmpeg-build-script](https://github.com/markus-perl/ffmpeg-build-script/blob/master/build-ffmpeg): Markus did a great job on gathering requirements for multiple components. But I can't use it because of Bash. Bash is a real shit: fragile syntax, no debug, no IDE, no error reporting, nothing. Therefore, it's time to build something similar with a real programming language.

## Usage

* Build:`python3 hello.py --build` and follow on-screen instructions
* Clean:`python3 hello.py --clean`
* Help:`python3 hello.py --help`
